```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(singer)
data("singer_locations")

```


```{r}
# artist_hottness, artist_familiarity, duration
hfd_y <- singer_locations %>%
  select(song_id,year,duration:artist_familiarity) %>% #select columns that we want to gather.
  gather(key= "Measures", value = "My_value",
         duration:artist_familiarity) # which column do we want to spread, this will select from duration to artist_familiarity.
# we throw away some information about the unique rows so we can cause problems later on when we want to spread.
# We need to find something that is unique, such as song_id
View(hfd_y)
```

```{r}
hfd_y %>%
  filter(year > 1950) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = My_value)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Measures, scales = "free_y") # want to free x and y scales if different groups have different ranges for x and y, or we can choose to just free one axis.
```
We need to modify the plots.



### Doomed challenge 1

```{r}
# Bring hfd_y in the wide format
hfd_y %>%
  spread(Measures, My_value) # I want to find 2007 three times but 2007 is not identified repeadly. It finds three values for duration 2007.
```


### Hopeful challenge 2
```{r}
# Fix hfd_y )build it better, gather and spread
# Spread and gather will only work when there is an unique identifier 

```

```{r}
install.packages("reshape2")
```
```{r}
hfd_y_mean <-hfd_y %>%
  reshape2::dcast(year - Measures,
        value.var="My_value",
        fun.aggregate=mean, na.rm=TRUE) # can tell reshape2 that there are more than two 
# aggregate function - when we have more than one values, we use aggregation function - take in more than one value and return one value
# when there is more than one value, use mean 
View(hfd_y_mean)
```
