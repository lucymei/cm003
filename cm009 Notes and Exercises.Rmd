After going through the `dplyr` [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html) on "two-table verbs", we'll work on the following exercises.
# how to join two data frames
1. Mutating joins - adding new coloums from new data frame
2. Filtering joins - take original table and subset it
3. Set operations - take two tables with the same variables, intersection, unions, set difference, etc.

```{r}
library("nycflights13")
flights2 <- flights %>% select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)

flights2 %>% 
  left_join(airlines)
# finds common variables in both data frames and match up to map the names
# if the name is not found, it will keep rows in the original one, and also keep things that are not found

# inner join - only combine things in common
# outer join - keep rows from both data sets


# coloum a - 0, 1, 2; column val1 - 15, 13, 101
# coloum a - 0,3,2; name - canada, Indian, China

# left join (x,y) - keep everything in x, try to match against y
# Since both data set has column a, but not name, this will generate a new coloum called "name", to add the things that match to column a, and anything that is not matched will return "NA"
# return, column a - 0,1,2; column val1 - 15, 13, 101; name - Canada, NA, China
# if there is a duplicate on the first column, it will return one more column stating the match for the second one


# inner join
# return, column a -


# outer join
# return, column a - 0,1,2,3; val1 - 15,12,101,NA; name - Canada, NA, China, India

```


Consider the following areas of countries, in hectares:

```{r}
(areas <- data.frame(country=c("Canada", "United States", "India", "Vatican City"),
                     area=c(998.5*10^6, 983.4*10^6, 328.7*10^6, 44)) %>% 
     as.tbl)
```


1. To the `gapminder` dataset, add an `area` variable using the `areas` tibble. Be sure to preserve all the rows of the original `gapminder` dataset.
```{r}
left_join(gapminder, areas)
```


2. To the `gapminder` dataset, add an `area` variable using the `areas` tibble, but only keeping obervations for which areas are available. 
```{r}
inner_join(gapminder, areas)
```



3. Use a `_join` function to output the rows in `areas` corresponding to countries that _are not_ found in the `gapminder` dataset. 
```{r}
anti_join(areas, gapminder)
```



4. Use a `_join` function to output the rows in `areas` corresponding to countries that _are_ found in the `gapminder` dataset. 
```{r}
semi_join(areas, gapminder)
```



5. Construct a tibble that joins `gapminder` and `areas`, so that all rows found in each original tibble are also found in the final tibble. 
```{r}
full_join(areas, gapminder) %>%
```



6. Subset the `gapminder` dataset to have countries that are only found in the `areas` data frame. 
```{r}
semi_join(gapminder, areas)
```


7. Subset the `gapminder` dataset to have countries that are _not_ found in the `areas` data frame. 
```{r}
anti_join(gapminder, areas)
```
