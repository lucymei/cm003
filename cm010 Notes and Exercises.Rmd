```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
left_join()
inner_join()
full_join()
anti_join()
semi_join()
```

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("JoeyBernhardt/singer")
```

Now we have the singer dataframes

```{r}
library(singer)
```

and then we load into the environment the datasets

```{r}
data("locations")
data("songs")
```

and we can give a look at them

```{r}
glimpse(songs)
```

```{r}
glimpse(locations)
```

```{r}
View(songs)
View(locations)
```

### Release and Year
Produce a dataframe with all the albums, the artists and the year in which album was published.

```{r}
relartyear <- inner_join(locations, songs, by= c("title", "artist_name")) %>%
  select(release, artist_name,year)

View(relartyear)

```
We can use title to join because each title is unique.
Can aligned by two variables.


### challenge 1
Get the number of releases per year

```{r}
inner_join(songs, locations, by="title") %>%
  count(year)
```

## Reshaping

```{r}
data("singer_locations")
glimpse(singer_locations)

View(singer_locations) #This is a wide data frame - all in a wide horizontal form
```
```{r}
hfd_y <- singer_locations %>%
  select(year, artist_hotttnesss, artist_familiarity, duration)

hfd_y %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=duration)) +
  geom_line()
```
There is missing data in years and it causes the weird graph.
We need to filter out some years.
```{r}
hfd_y %>%
  filter(year >1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=duration)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
hfd_y %>%
  filter(year >1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=artist_hotttnesss)) +
  geom_point()
```


To get a long data frame.
package "tidyr", "gather()": from wide to long
```{r}
hfd_y_long <- hfd_y %>%
  gather(key="Measure", value = "Units", artist_hotttnesss:duration)

View(hfd_y)
View(hfd_y_long)
```
```{r}
hfd_y_long %>%
  filter(year > 1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = Units)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Measure)
```
How to fix the scale?
```{r}
hfd_y_long %>%
  filter(year > 1900) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = Units)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Measure) +
  
```
